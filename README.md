# MIPS Emulator

This project is a work-in-progress emulator for the MIPS instruction set. It doesn't mean to have any purpose, I'm only doing this for fun and trying new ways of programming

## Status
**Still in development**

Currently, implementing:
- `lw` (Load Word)
- `sw` (Store Word)

## Goal
The main objective is to implement all instructions and system calls as defined in the [MIPS Instruction Set](https://www.dsi.unive.it/~gasparetto/materials/MIPS_Instruction_Set.pdf).

## Features
- Emulates basic MIPS instructions.
